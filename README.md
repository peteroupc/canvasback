A JavaScript that displays a canvas-based background that draws shapes
in about the same color as the background color.   If WebGL is
supported, the shapes will be in 3D; otherwise they will
be simple rectangles.

To use, include jQuery and the "canvasback.js" script in your
HTML.  See "[canvasback.html](http://peteroupc.github.io/canvasback/canvasback.html)" for a demo.
